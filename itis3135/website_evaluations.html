        <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
        <p>This site is to inform readers on the Basic CRAP principles in front-end development using HTML.</p>
        <p>CRAP stands for Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity.</p>
        <p>Below are two websites that I have evaluated based on these principles.</p>
        <section>
            <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/dashboard">
                <h3>Good Website</h3>
            </a>
            <ul>
                <li>The contrast is simple black lettering on white background. Makes for easy accessiblity.</li>
                <li>The site keeps a consistent model as you navigate through to other pages within it.</li>
                <li>Alignment structure is very good and is consistent all the way through.</li>
                <li>Though some items are very close together, most of the items are large enough to stand out and not give a "too close" feel.</li>
            </ul>

            <a href="https://userinyerface.com/game.html">
                <h3>Bad Website</h3>
            </a>
            <ul>
                <li>The contrast on this site is not terrible, however the green against the blue can cause accessiblity concerns.</li>
                <li>There is no clear structure to this site as it changes with each and every input.</li>
                <li>The alignment is centered at first, but as you progress you start to find more items that are not aligned.</li>
                <li>Everything is very close together and the site does not utilize much of the space it has.</li>
            </ul>
